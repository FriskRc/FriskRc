- 👋 Hi, I’m @FriskRc
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding as I've had an injury that has made a change of career from one of phsyical effort to mental effort.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the CS50 and independent reading 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing quite yet, but I will need a mentor at some point
- 📫 How to reach me rc.frisk@hotmail.com
